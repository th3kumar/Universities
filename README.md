# Your Android App Name

## Overview

Briefly describe your Android app and its purpose.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- Android SDK
- Retrofit (for API requests)
- MVVM Architecture
- Foreground Service

## App Architecture Overview

Your Android app follows a common MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with the addition of a foreground service for data refresh. Here's a high-level description of the key components and their interactions:

1. **UI Layer (View):**
   - Activities: The app likely consists of one or more activities (e.g., `MainActivity`) responsible for displaying the user interface.
   - Layouts: XML layout files define the UI components and their arrangement on the screen.
   - RecyclerView: A RecyclerView is used to display a list of universities fetched from the API.

2. **ViewModel Layer:**
   - `UniversityViewModel`: This ViewModel class acts as an intermediary between the UI and the data. It retrieves data from the repository, processes it, and provides it to the UI components.
   - LiveData: LiveData objects are used to hold and observe data changes in a lifecycle-aware manner.

3. **Repository Layer:**
   - `UniversityRepository`: The repository abstracts the data source (the API in this case) and provides clean APIs to access and fetch university data.
   - API Interface: An interface (`ApiInterface`) defines the API endpoints for fetching university data. It uses Retrofit to make network requests.

4. **Service Layer:**
   - `DataRefreshService`: This foreground service is responsible for periodically refreshing data from the API. It runs even when the app is in the background or closed. It uses a Handler and coroutines to schedule API requests at regular intervals.

5. **Networking Layer:**
   - Retrofit: Retrofit is used to make HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

6. **Notification Manager:**
   - Android's Notification Manager is used to create a foreground notification for the `DataRefreshService`. This notification informs the user that the service is running and helps keep the service in the foreground.

## Architecture Flow

1. When the app is launched (`MainActivity`), it initializes the `UniversityViewModel`.

2. The `UniversityViewModel` fetches university data from the `UniversityRepository`.

3. The `UniversityRepository` uses Retrofit to make API requests to retrieve university data.

4. Fetched data is observed by the UI (RecyclerView) through LiveData, and it is displayed to the user.

5. Meanwhile, the `DataRefreshService` runs in the background, periodically making API requests to refresh data.

6. The `DataRefreshService` posts the updated data to the `UniversityViewModel`, which in turn updates the UI when new data is received.

This architecture ensures that the UI remains responsive, and data is periodically refreshed in the background, even when the app is not in the foreground.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a "Saved Universities" feature to allow users to bookmark universities of interest.
- Add a "Search Universities" feature to enable users to search for specific universities based on criteria.
